# Jira & Confluence Management Ruleset

This ruleset defines the standard patterns for interacting with Atlassian resources. **All operations MUST target the WorldOfTech environment.**

## 1. Target Environment

- **Jira Project Name:** `WorldOfTech`
- **Jira Project Key:** `WOT`
- **Confluence Space Key:** `WOT` (WorldOfTech - verify if renamed)
- **Cloud Instance:** `ar1603.atlassian.net`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every Jira issue created or modified MUST use `projectKey: "WOT"`.
> Every Confluence page created or searched MUST use `spaceId: "HO"` or `spaceKey: "HO"`.

## 2. Naming Conventions

- **Epic Linking:** EVERY Story, Task, and Bug MUST be linked to a corresponding Epic. When using the API, specify the Epic using the `parent: { "key": "EPIC-KEY" }` field.
- **Platform Prefixing:** Every ticket summary MUST start with a platform identifier in brackets:
  - `[Web]` for feature-related stories/tasks.
  - `[Core]` for shared or infrastructure-related tasks.
  - `[Design]` for UI/UX and styling tasks.
- **Example:** `[Web] Implement login form validation`

## 3. Active Epics (Project: WOT)

- **WOT-1**: `[Core] Infrastructure & Modernization`
- **WOT-2**: `[Web] Web app feature`
- **WOT-3**: `[Design] Visual Excellence`
- **WOT-4**: `[Core] Localization & Accessibility`

## 4. Issue Types & Templates

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unless explicitly specified otherwise, always use **Story** as the default issue type for new ticket requests.

### Story

Use for user-facing features and functionality.
**Description Template:**

```markdown
## Background:

## Details

## Acceptance criteria:

## Implementation notes.
```

### Task

Use for technical setup, maintenance, or infrastructure work. (Follow Story template structure if complex).

### Bug

Use for defects or errors.
**Description Template:**

```markdown
## Background:

## Details

## Acceptance criteria:

- {use number bullet points}
- {requirement 1}
- {requirement 2}

## Repro steps

## QA notes
```

### Epic

Use for high-level project goals or features.

## 5. Labeling

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Every ticket MUST have at least one platform-specific label (`Web`, `Design`, `Packages`, or `Core`).**

- Apply platform-specific labels (`Web`, `Design`, `Packages`, `Core`) to every issue for easy filtering.
- Link all stories and tasks to their corresponding **Epic**.

## 6. Workflow & Statuses

Standard project workflow statuses to target:

- **Story/Tasks:** Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done, Won't do.
- **Bugs:** Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done, Won't do, In Testing, Duplicate.

## 7. Field Requirements

- **Priority:** Must have a value. Do not attempt to set to null or clear via API as it is a required system field.
- **Description:** MUST use the templates defined in section 3. Provide a clear summary of work and explicit acceptance criteria.

## 8. Link Formatting (Strict Rule)

When adding comments via API (`addCommentToJiraIssue`):

1. **MUST** set `contentFormat: "markdown"`.
2. **MUST** use standard Markdown `[Title](URL)` syntax.
3. If title linkification is critical, provide the raw URL in parentheses after the title.
4. **DO NOT** use Wiki Markup `[Title|URL]` as it fails in ADF-default environments.
